# PineappleCAS [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nathanfarlow/PineappleCAS.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/nathanfarlow/PineappleCAS)

A generic CAS targeted for the TI-84+ CE calculators. Designed as a faster, cleaner, more useful, memory-leak-free alternative to the [SymbolicDerivative](https://github.com/nathanfarlow/SymbolicDerivative) project.

PineappleCAS uses the imath library for arbitrary precision math: https://github.com/creachadair/imath
